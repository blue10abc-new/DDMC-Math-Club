Download and extract the included mod's ZIP. Get the official DDLC game from ddlc.moe. Go into the game folder of the official game, and add the official game's images.rpa, audio.rpa, and fonts.rpa into the mod's game folder, or it will throw an error. Run the EXE (or SH for Linux) and enjoy! There will be broken save files, a default username, and a messed up start screen, which are remnants from my testing (IDK how to remove them).
